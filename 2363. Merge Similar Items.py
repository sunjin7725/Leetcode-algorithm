"""
You are given two 2D integer arrays, items1 and items2, representing two sets of items. Each array items has the following properties:

items[i] = [valuei, weighti] where valuei represents the value and weighti represents the weight of the ith item.
The value of each item in items is unique.
Return a 2D integer array ret where ret[i] = [valuei, weighti], with weighti being the sum of weights of all items with value valuei.

Note: ret should be returned in ascending order by value.

Input: items1 = [[1,1],[4,5],[3,8]], items2 = [[3,1],[1,5]]
Output: [[1,6],[3,9],[4,5]]
Explanation:
The item with value = 1 occurs in items1 with weight = 1 and in items2 with weight = 5, total weight = 1 + 5 = 6.
The item with value = 3 occurs in items1 with weight = 8 and in items2 with weight = 1, total weight = 8 + 1 = 9.
The item with value = 4 occurs in items1 with weight = 5, total weight = 5.
Therefore, we return [[1,6],[3,9],[4,5]].

items1 = [[1, 1], [4, 5], [3, 8]]
items2 = [[3, 1], [1, 5]]
